# Apple App Store frontend source code archive - Forked

Extracted from [https://apps.apple.com/](https://apps.apple.com/). Saved using the Chrome extension [Save All Resources](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-all-resources/abpdnfjocnmdomablahdcfnoggeeiedb).

### How is this possible?

Because Apple forgot to disable sourcemaps in production on the App Store website 🙃

As an interesting discovery, I've archived them here on GitHub for educational purposes.
